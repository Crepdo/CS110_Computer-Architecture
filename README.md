# CS110_Computer-Architecture
Projects of Shanghaitech _CS110 Computer-Architecture_ which based on:  
UCB _CS61C Great Ideas in Computer Architecture (Machine Structures)_

## Projects Introduction
### Project 1: RISC-V Assembler & Disassembler

RISC-V - Machine Code assembler & disassembler.

### Project 2: CPU and Datapath

A simulated CPU with a whole Datapath, including all parts like ALUs and registers to accomplish a small RISCV instruction set. (Based on _Logisim_)


### Project 3: Crypto Coin Mining and Hash Function Optimization
The task is to use multiple methods like multithread to optimize the SHA256 hash function in a Crypto Coin mining process.
### Project 4: Longan_Board_RISC-V_Game
It is a RISC-V and C based  game on a [longan- nano][2]  board. We named it _SPACE RESCUE_. 
The ATARI-styled introduction booklet and outer controller hardware are build for fun and completion.
